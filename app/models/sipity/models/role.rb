  module Models
    # A named concept that represents a set of responsibilities/verbs.
    # Often confused for a Group. Group represents people.
    # Roles represent what can/is done by anything/anyone having the given role.
    #
    # @note Should this be in the Processing submodule? Perhaps. This model
    #   representes the "roles" that users of the system can have. It is not
    #   the "role" that they had in relation to the scholarly work that is
    #   being deposited (i.e. co-author on a paper).
