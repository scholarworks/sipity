    # A role is a responsibility to do things. That is to take actions. It is
    # easy to conflate a person's role with the groups to which they belong.
    # A group is a set of people. The association of group with role
    # indicates that the set of people have the same responsibilities.
    #
    # By separating Group and Role, we expose a more rich system in which we
    # can talk about group membership separate from the group's
    # responsibility.
    #
    # Another way to think of it is that a Group is a marco that expands to
    # represent people. A Role is a macro that expands to represent
    # responsibilities. In keeping them separate we can model more rich
    # relationships.
    #
    # @note Roles should be verbs. They are what you do.
    #
    # @note Should this be in the Processing submodule? Perhaps. This model
    #   representes the "roles" that users of the system can have. It is not
    #   the "role" that they had in relation to the scholarly work that is
    #   being deposited (i.e. co-author on a paper).
