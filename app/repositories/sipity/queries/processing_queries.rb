    # Welcome intrepid developer. You have stumbled into some complex data
    # interactions. There are a lot of data collaborators regarding these tests.
    # I would love this to be more in isolation, but that is not in the cards as
    # there are at least 16 database tables interacting to ultimately answer the
    # following question:
    #
    # * What actions can a given user take on an entity?
    #
    # Could there be more efficient queries? Yes. However, the composition of
    # queries has proven to be a very powerful means of understanding and
    # exploring the problem.
    #
    # @note There is an indication of public or private api. The intent of this
    #   is to differentiate what are methods that are the primary entry points
    #   as understood as of the commit that has the @api tag. However, these are
    #   public methods because they have been tested in isolation and are used
    #   to help compose the `@api public` methods.
