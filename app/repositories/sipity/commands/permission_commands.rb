    # TODO: Need to come up with a better way of handling this. Exposing
    # module functions and instance methods is a bit insane. It works, but
    # increases coupling. Possible solution, module provides a means for
    # delegation to a proper class? The design goal is to provide a way for
    # accessing repository services in other contexts. So the question is:
    # How is that different from module functions and instance methods via
    # mixin? Something to think about.
