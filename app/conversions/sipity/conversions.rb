module Sipity
  # Taking a que from Avdi Grimm's "Confident Ruby", the Conversion module
  # is responsible for coercing the inputs to another format.
  #
  # This is somewhat experimental, though analogous to the Array() method in
  # base ruby.
  #
  # This module is defined here to provide the top-level declaration.
